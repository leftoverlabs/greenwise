How To Install Python:

Visit the official Python website at www.python.org.

Go to the "Downloads" section and click on the version you wish to install, the system will automatically recognize your OS.
Once the executable file is downloaded, run it. In the first installation window, make sure you check the box "Add Python to PATH" before clicking "Install Now".
Wait until the setup finishes, then click the “Install Now” button.

To verify if Python is installed:
Open Command Prompt or PowerShell in Windows 11.

Type python --version and press Enter.

If Python is installed correctly, the console will print the Python version.

Installing Python Libraries:
To install Python Libraries, you can use pip, which is a package installer for Python. The installation command usually follows this format: pip install library-name.

For example:

- To install Pillow, the command is: pip install Pillow
- To install automationhat, the command is: pip install automationhat
- To install st7735, the command is: pip install st7735

These commands should be entered and executed in your console.

About the Libraries:
-Pillow: This is a fork of the Python Imaging Library (PIL). It adds some user-friendly features to PIL, such as easier installation, support for a broader range of images, and better support for various operating systems.
-automationhat: This library is used in conjunction with the Automation HAT, a hardware accessory for the Raspberry Pi that allows you to control motors, read sensors, and other hardware-related tasks.
-st7735: This is a Python library for the ST7735 series of TFT LCD displays. You can use this library to control the display on a Raspberry Pi or other microcontrollers.
